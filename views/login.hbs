    <h1>This is a dummy login page. Press the login button to proceed.</h1>

    <p>For the sake of this sprint, I have created the architecture of the backend, but filled it out with dummy functions.</p><br>
    <p>Most, if not all, of the required routes for the finished product have been defined. As the summer continues, we will replace the dummy functions with the desired business logic and functionality.</p>
    <p>For now, each page will display directions for how to test each route.</p>
    <p>This demo also has a fully functioning database, but this front-end demo does not utilize it.</p>

    <p>Indicate whether you want the login to fail or succeed.</p>
    <p>After a successful login, click the /home link to continue.</p>

    {{#if errorMessage}}
